  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the RobotRoom service (“Service”) operated by BC Innovation Labs LLC DBA PictPerfect (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), located at 10922 80th Pl NE, Kirkland, WA 98034. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please discontinue use of the Service immediately.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility and Use of Service</h2>
  <p>The Service is intended for families and their children to interact with advanced AI-driven robots in an educational and entertaining environment. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on behalf of any child participant. You agree that any child under your care who uses the Service does so under your supervision and responsibility.</p>

  <h2>2. Privacy and Protection of Children</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our Privacy Policy, which also outlines our compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal information, including any information collected from children under 13. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our Privacy Policy and consent to the handling of information as described therein.</p>

  <h2>3. Permitted Uses and Restrictions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Use:</strong> The Service is provided for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly display, perform, republish, download, store, or transmit the material provided through the Service, except as allowed by these Terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Prohibited Conduct:</strong> You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose, to engage in any conduct that may harm others, or to interfere with the Service’s proper operation. This includes, but is not limited to, attempting to access unauthorized systems, introducing malicious code, or harassing staff or other users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, features, and functionalities available through the Service—including but not limited to text, images, videos, graphics, logos, trademarks, and the underlying software—are owned or licensed by the Company or its affiliates and are protected by intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Service solely for its intended purposes. No other license or right is granted, and all other rights are expressly reserved by the Company.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may integrate with or provide access to third-party platforms, APIs, or services necessary for functionality, such as audio processing, voice recognition, or data anonymization. While we take steps to ensure these integrations are secure and reliable, we are not responsible for the content, performance, or policies of third-party providers. Your use of third-party services may be subject to separate terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>6. Assumption of Risk and Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p><strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> Interacting with AI-driven robots and participating in experiential activities involves inherent risks, including potential technical malfunctions or unexpected behavior. By using the Service, you assume all risks associated with these activities, whether known or unknown.</p>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without any guarantees that it will meet your requirements, operate uninterrupted, or be error-free.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Company, its affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service, including but not limited to personal injury, property damage, loss of profits, or data breach, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
  <p>If liability cannot be excluded, to the greatest extent allowed by law, the Company’s total liability shall be limited to the amount you paid, if any, to use the Service.</p>

  <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, actions, demands, damages, liabilities, and settlements, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Modification and Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service or any part thereof at any time without notice. We may also modify these Terms at our discretion. When we make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to them or the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any claim or dispute between you and the Company that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in King County, Washington.</p>

  <h2>11. Severability and Waiver</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

  <h2>12. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices posted on the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements or understandings between you and the Company.</p>
