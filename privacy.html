  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the RobotRoom service (“Service”) provided by BC Innovation Labs LLC DBA PictPerfect (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), located at 10922 80th Pl NE, Kirkland, WA 98034. RobotRoom is an experiential kids play environment where children interact with advanced AI-driven robots. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors, including children under the age of 13, and we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>We understand the importance of safeguarding children’s personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information obtained through our Service. By using RobotRoom, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Service.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Child Personal Information:</strong> We may collect personal information from children only to the extent that is reasonably necessary for them to participate in the activities offered by RobotRoom. Types of information may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> Audio data that may capture a child’s voice during their interaction with robots.</li>
    <li><strong>Images or Video:</strong> Still images or video footage that may include a child’s likeness while they are participating in activities at RobotRoom.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We endeavor to minimize the amount of personal information collected and will obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from a child under 13, where required by law.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>The information collected from children is used solely for the purpose of providing and enhancing the RobotRoom experience. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Facilitating the interaction between children and the robots, including enabling AI-driven responses and activities.</li>
    <li>Improving the functionality and user experience of the Service, such as refining voice recognition or adjusting difficulty levels of educational tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use children’s personal information for marketing or advertising purposes. We will not condition a child’s participation in any activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary.</p>

  <h2>4. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not share personal information with third parties for marketing, profiling, or other unrelated purposes. However, to enable the core functionality of our Service, we may share anonymized or pseudonymized data with trusted third-party service providers via secure APIs. These third-party providers assist in processing audio or visual data to allow our robots to interact and respond more effectively to children.</p>
  <p><strong>Anonymization/Pseudonymization:</strong> Before sharing any data with our service providers, we remove or alter any information that could identify a specific child. For example, facial features may be converted into abstract data points and voices may be translated into anonymized acoustic patterns. This ensures the data cannot be used to identify a child outside the context of providing the requested service.</p>

  <h2>5. Parental Rights and Control</h2>
  <p>Parents and legal guardians have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Review Information:</strong> Request to review the personal information we have collected about their child.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Deletion:</strong> Request that we delete their child’s personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Revoke Consent:</strong> Withdraw consent at any time, and upon doing so, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing the child’s personal information going forward.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address or email provided below.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children’s personal information. We use industry-standard security measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure storage. Despite our efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the complete security of any information.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain children’s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and as permitted by law. Once the information is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

  <h2>8. COPPA Compliance</h2>
  <p>We comply with COPPA by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Obtaining verifiable parental consent when required.</li>
    <li>Not using children’s personal information for marketing or unrelated purposes.</li>
    <li>Allowing parents to review, delete, and control their child’s personal information as described above.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. International Users</h2>
  <p>Our Service is intended for use in the United States. If you use the Service from outside the United States, you understand that your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S. By using the Service, you consent to such transfer and processing.</p>

  <h2>10. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to remain informed.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to exercise your parental rights as described, please contact our Data Protection Officer:</p>
  <p><strong>Data Protection Officer (DPO):</strong> Nick Rackley<br>
  <strong>Address:</strong> 10922 80th Pl NE, Kirkland, WA 98034<br>
  <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:dpo@pictperfect.com">dpo@pictperfect.com</a></p>
